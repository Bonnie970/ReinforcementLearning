This repo contains the implementation of the Dueling Bandits algorithms proposed in the following paper:
https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/tj/publications/yue_etal_09a.pdf

Some empirical results are presented, and general observations and key points of the paper are summarized.

See Dueling_Bandits.ipynb for more details.

duelingBandits1.py and duelingBandits2.py are where we tested our initial implementations.
